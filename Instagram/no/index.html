  <h1 id="title">Instagram Bubble</h1>
  <div id="text">
    <p>This is a class project, in which I study one internet platform, its advantages as well as disavatages base on my personal preference. One of the most widely used platforms is Instagram, where you share your thoughts, moments and photos. On Instagram there is a functions called Explore page, where you can view post of people that I am not following. 
    Often time, I do not pay much attention to what I see on the explore page. Until I started this project, I noticed that the posts on my explore page are every similar to each other and right below the posts, Instagram leaves notes such as based on people you, base on photos you like, base on account you interact with and so on. So, Instagram show me what it supposes that I am interested in. However, I am not so sure that I am interested in the posts on my explore page. Instead, Instagram is using my informations to categorize me and group me with accounts and posts that it thinks similar to me.
    If you are not an Instagram user, I hope you learnt more about Instagram through my page. I have created an Instagram account where I explained step by step how to avoid being classified my Instagram. If you would like to know more about my project follow my account below</p>
